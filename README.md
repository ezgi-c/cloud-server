# Lab 16 - AWS: Cloud Servers

## Deployed Servers

[deployed server 1](http://expressserver-env-1.eba-ehmp3vas.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

[deployed server 2](http://expressserver-env-2.eba-ehmp3vas.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## Process

The deployment did not succeed when I tried to upload my own code of a basic express server. I found a sample file in AWS documentation and tried deploying that, which was successful. I was not able to figure out how to troubleshoot the deployment that did not work. I will need to ask for asistance from instructors or TA's to figure out what went wrong.
